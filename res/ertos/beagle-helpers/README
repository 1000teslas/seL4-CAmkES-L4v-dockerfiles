To run images under qemu for the Beagle is a little involved.

In short:

 $ ./beagle_create_image hello-image-arm hello-nand.bin
 $ qemu-system-arm -M beagle -nographic -mtdblock hello-nand.bin



In the long:

The beagle emulation only supports booting from a NAND or SD image.
SD emulation support is not yet sufficient for u-boot to read images from it.
So the only option left is to put everything into a NAND image.

The NAND image must contain the following (in keeping with the standard Beagle
NAND layout):

 - x-load (modified to remove NAND ECC correction)
    at address 0 in NAND
 - u-boot (modified to remove NAND ECC correction, and boot image automatically)
    at address 0x80000 in NAND
 - target image
    at address 0x280000 in NAND

Binaries are provided for x-load and u-boot for convenience here, as well
as the modified sources (against their original repositories).


To rebuild stuff:

(tested with Codesourcery 2010q1)
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-

Build /data/git_root/beagle/qemu-sim/x-load-omap3/:

cd x-load-omap3/
make omap3530beagle_config
make
./signGP x-load.bin

Build /data/git_root/beagle/qemu-sim/u-boot/:
cd u-boot
make omap3_beagle_config
make

Build /data/git_root/beagle/qemu-sim/qemu-maemo.git/:
cd qemu-maemo/
./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu
make
